# PreCorrector

PreCorrector (short for Preconditioner Corrector) is a GNN-based approach for constructing preconditioners for iterative methods. See details in [Learning from linear algebra: A graph neural network approach to preconditioner design for conjugate gradient solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15557).
